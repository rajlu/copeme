# Copeme (JavaScript chrome extension version)

Hello there! That's one of my earliest `JavaScript` projects that I made. This is simple bot (or web scraper) that will buy (more like try to buy) clothes on [supreme](https://www.supremenewyork.com) site.

> This code is ugly and I can't remember what everything does

> I made this long time ago

> I think it is not fast enough to cop most hype items

> Sorry for my London

**I will try to remake this (maybe in Python)**
